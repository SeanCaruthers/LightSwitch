For Grader    :      This app is currently up and running/playable at URL, however,
                     if you would like to run it locally, then you will need use node to install the dependencies
                     throught the "npm install" command and then launch the app via "node app.js", the app is set
                     up to run on port 8340, but if that port is taken, then you will need to modify the port
                     number specified in the app.js file.  Again, it would probably be a lot easier to just view the
                     app at the specified url.  All of the app logic is included in public/js/LightSwitch.js and
                     styling is included in public/js/LightSwitch.css


Description   :      LightSwitch is a NP-Hard game that is based off of 3CNF.

Goal          :      Turn on all of the lights by flipping switches

Rules         :      The player starts with j light connected to k switches via 3 wires.  
                     Each light is connected to the switches via a direct wire or an inverted wire. 
                     There are four possible states for each switch wire combo:

                         Switch on and direct wire    = current running
                         Switch off and inverted wire = current running
                         Switch on and inverted wire  = no current
                         Switch off and direct wire   = no current

                     A light will turn on if it is receiving current from at least one switch.
                     A light will turn off it is is not receiving current from any switches.
                     
          
Setup       :        The user is prompted to enter two numbers to determine the difficulty
                     level of the game:
                          
                          The first number corresponds to the number of lights.
                          The second number corresponds to the number of switches.
                     
                     Once the choice is made, the screen will populate with the game variables.
